# 👋 Welcome to Parthy Lab

**Parthy** is a full-stack autonomous delivery robot system created by [Demian](https://github.com/YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT).  
This lab showcases a complete robotics ecosystem built from scratch — combining hardware, software, vision, motion, and control into a single long-term engineering mission.

> 💡 Inspired by Serve Robotics and Waymo.  
> 🧠 Driven by curiosity, learning, and systems thinking.  
> 🎯 Goal: Become a robotics engineer contributing to real-world autonomous mobility.

## 🛠️ What We're Building

| Subsystem | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🧠 `parthy-core-cpp` | Core motor control, movement logic, and hardware interfaces in C++ (Raspberry Pi + L298N) |
| 🎥 `parthy-vision-ml` | Object detection and perception using Python, OpenCV, and camera input |
| 📱 `parthy-ios-controller` | SwiftUI-based mobile app to track delivery status and robot activity |
| 🌐 `parthy-server` | Python FastAPI backend to handle status logs and app communication |
| 📦 `parthy-ecosystem` | Central documentation, diagrams, build logs, and portfolio presentation (this repo) |

## 🔍 Why Parthy?

> This project is more than just motors and wheels — it’s a personal research lab for exploring autonomy.

Parthy is:
- 💻 Coded from scratch
- ⚙️ Fully modular
- 🚗 Capable of real delivery logic (short-range, 1–2 miles)
- 🧪 A platform to learn and build meaningful robotics

We’re documenting every step — from 3D chassis design to API structure to onboard AI.

## 🤖 Meet Joseph

Every lab needs its first test unit.  
**Joseph** is Parthy’s first delivery robot — equipped with mecanum wheels, ultrasonic sensors, IR tracking, and a camera for vision.  
You'll find logs, test footage, and updates inside the repos.

## 📸 Gallery / Demo (Coming Soon)

We’ll be uploading:
- Diagrams & wiring maps
- Assembly progress photos
- Video clips of Parthy in action
- Demo walkthroughs
